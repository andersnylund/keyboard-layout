# keyboard-layout

A set of configs for a more productive keyboard layout ðŸš€

## What is this?

A layout that adds a "function" or "hyper" layer to your keyboard. Inspired by the default layout of Vortex Pok3r 60% keyboard.

- [`iso_karabiner.json`](iso_karabiner.json) is for your MacOS with ISO keyboard using [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements)
- [`ansi_karabiner.json`](ansi_karabiner.json) is for your MacOS with ANSI layout also using [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements)
- [`layout.ahk`](layout.ahk) is for your Windows with ISO layout using [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
