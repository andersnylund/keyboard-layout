# keyboard-layout
A set of configs for a more productive keyboard layout ðŸš€

## What is this?

A layout that adds a "function" or "hyper" layer to your keyboard. Inspired by the default layout of Vortex Pok3r 60% keyboard.
`karabiner.json` is for your MacOS with help of [Karabiner-Elements](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjp-MLomoDmAhVhyqYKHaajAfEQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpqrs.org%2Fosx%2Fkarabiner%2F&usg=AOvVaw3Q6ftWJftSWzm_7nI7FGTJ), and `layout.ahk` for [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
